* IN-PROGRESS Restating Financial Statements
** Definitions 
*** Accounting
**** ASSETS = LIABILITIES + EQUITY
***** Operating Assets = Operating Liabilities + LT Debt + Equity
**** WORKING CAPITAL: The categories related to the cycle of business operations i.e. inventory, accounts receivable, and accounts payable.
**** 
*** Corporate Finance
**** RETURN = PROFIT/INVESTMENT
**** FCF = NOPLAT − Net Increase in Invested Capital
*** Basic Principles
**** Logic of differentiation between operating/financial parts of company during valuation
**** Need for reorganization of financial statements
** Calculating Investment(IC = "Investment Capital")
*** Theory
**** Invested Capital = LT Debt + Equity = Operating Assets − Operating Liabilities
**** Total Funds Invested = Invested Capital + Non Operating Assets

** Calculating Return(NOPLAT = "Net Operating Profit Less Adjusted Taxes")
*** Theory
**** NOPLAT is operating profit available to both debt/equity holders.
*** Procedure
**** First, interest is not subtracted from operating profit, because interest is considered a payment to the company’s financial investors, not an operating expense 
**** Second, exclude any nonoperating income generated from assets that were excluded from invested capital
**** Thirdly, to calculate operating taxes, start with reported taxes, add back the tax shield caused by interest expense, and remove the taxes paid on nonoperating income.
*** Calculations

** Calculating Cashflow(FCF = "Free Cash Flow")

* TODO Estimating Cost of Capital
** Definitions 
*** K_{eu}: unlevered cost of equity
    Rate of return acceptable by equity investors in a completely unlevered firm. Reflects the risk profile associated with corporate assets ignoring capital structure.
*** K_{d}: levered cost of equity
    Rate of return acceptable by a form debt.
*** WACC = (D/V)*K_{d}*(1 - T) + (E/V)*k_{e}
** Estimated unlevered cost of equity
*** CAPM
    R_{i} = r_{f} + B_{i}[R_{m} - r_{f}]
    Here,  Beta represents a stock’s incremental risk to a diversified investor, where risk is defined as the extent to which the stock covaries with the aggregate stock market. High beta means company must earn and offer higher return to entice investors.
**** Estimating Risk free rate r_{f}: use zero coupon treasury bonds
**** Estimating Market risk premium: 5-6%
**** Estimating Beta
     Use industry beta, instead of company beta. To undo/normalise the effect of leverage use Modiligani and Miller.
** Estimating cost of debt
   After-Tax Cost of Debt = Cost of Debt × (1 − T_{m})

  The multiples method seeks to develop a relationship between the actual price of shares of comparable listed companies and an accounting metric (such as net income, cash flows, revenues, etc.)

|------------------+-----------------------------|
| Enterprise Value | Equity Value                |
|------------------+-----------------------------|
| EV/EBIT          | Price by Earning: P/E       |
| EV/EBITDA        | Price by Cash earning: P/CE |
| EV/Sales         | Price by Book Value: P/BV   |
|------------------+-----------------------------|

**  Theory
*** Assumptions
**** The company’s value changes proportionally to the internal variables chosen as a measure of performance;
**** The growth rates of both cash flows and the risk level are constant
*** Concept
  - The financial method creates cash flow projections based on estimations on cost of capital, and projection on growth rate.
  - The multiples method avoids these estimations and takes the expected growth rate and risk appreciation directly from market data through the use of multiples.
**** Stock and Deal Multiples
     Multiples can refer to values taken from two different market contexts:
     - The stock market
     - The market for corporate control
     MARKET VALUE = STAND ALONE VALUE + PREMIUM
**** Financial and Business Multiples
***** Financial multiples identify the connection between a equity market price and some important measures such as cash flows, net income, or EBITDA
***** Business multiples link the equity market price to specific elements which are relevant for the business model typical of the sector the company(RPU for telecom i.e.)
*** Common multiples
**** P or EV 
     P can be calculated by EV by subtracting market value of debt.
**** Direct or Indirect
     - Direct: Measure how much value company is generating P/E, or EV/EBITDA
     - Indirect: Unable to measure this - P/BV, or EV/Sales
**** Current, Trailing, and Leading Multiples
     - Current: last available balance sheet
     - Trailing: last 12m
     - Leading: future results
|--------------+---------------+--------------|
| Current      | Trailing      | Leading      |
| P_{0}/E_{t0} | P_{0}/E_{ltm} | P_{0}/E_{t1} |

We should be consistet in which time period to choose in calculated, and then applying that multiple to variables.

* DONE Acquisition Value
  CLOSED: [2020-07-13 Mon 09:03] DEADLINE: <2020-07-06 Tue 20:00-23:55>
** Definitions
*** Acquisition Value = Stand-alone Value + Merger synergies from the point of view of a buyer :Definition:
*** Fair Market Value = based on operation company + Merger synergies in group of buyers  :Definition:
*** Three components of Acquisition Value
**** Stand-alone Value
**** Value from Incremental cash flows resulting for merger synergies in target firm.
**** Value of merger synergies obtained in other businesses led by controlling shareholders. 
** Value Created by an Acquisition
   NPV_{acq} = W_{acq} - P
   or the value created by and acquisition is equal to the PV of cashflows of acquired firm less the price paid for it.
*** Differential approach
   A scheme of analysis comparing two scenarios 1) Base case: without any acquisition, and 2) Innovation case: post acquisition.
  Therefore, value of acquisition of the target company = W_{acq(B)} = W_{A+B} - W_{A}
**** Effect on cash flow
     - Incremental flows due to collusive policies and consolidation
     - Incremental flows due to gains in operational efficiency
     - Incremental flows due to gains of intangible natures(marketing etc)
**** Effect on risk profile
     - Positive effects: Leverage over suppliers/buyers
     - Negative effects: in case of vertical integration
**** Effect on credit profile
     - If debts increases, so does EV due to tax shields.
*** Benefits
    W_{acq} = W_{base} + W_{s} + W_{o} where
    - W_{base} = base value
    - W_{s} = value of synergies
    - W_{o} = value of opportunities created by the acquisition

** Acquisition Value of Plastic Materials Company
*** Assumption
*** Synergy Estimation
*** Calculation
** Acquisition Value of Controlling Interests
   Usually, the value of a controlling stake is higher than the value of shares they represent.
   W = W_{Base Value} + W_{diff.flows}
   Where, W_{diff.flows} can be divided into value from cash flows that are
   - Divisible flows: Accuruing to target company and threfore available to all shareholders.
   - Indivisible flows: Accuring only to controlling interest or companies controlled by them
   Therefore the value for block of x shares is:
   *W_{x} = (W_{base} + W_{div})*x + W_{indiv}*

** Price Formation
*** Competitive Market
    The market for acquisitions is not competitive if, on the other hand, a significant number of firms is not interested in external growth opportunities.
*** Mechanism of Price formation
    From microeconomic theory, at equilibrium estimate of value for target firm should be identical.
    P = W_{acq}
    However, realistically W_{acq} is probably different for each firm due to difference in market plan/strategy. 
    W_{acq}y < P < W_{acq}xi

  CLOSED: [2020-07-06 Mon 17:32]
** Definitions
** Carbon Risk
*** *Policy and Legal*: Policies or regulations that could impact the operational and financial viability of carbon assets i.e. fuel efficiency standards
*** *Technology*: Developments in the commercial availability and cost of alternative and low-carbon technologies i.e. energy storage, alternative fuels etc.
*** *Market and Economic*: Changes in market or economic conditions that would negatively impact carbon assets i.e. changes in fossil fuel prices or consumer preferences
** Carbon Pricing
*** Approaches
   The objective of carbon pricing is to shift the social costs of damage back to those who are responsible for them, and who can actually curb them.
**** Carbon taxes
**** Emission trading systems(ETS)
*** External/Internal Carbon prices
    For managing internal projects.
** Valuation with Carbon risk
*** Scenario-Based Valuation and Carbon

** Problem 2
   Company Delta is listed on the market with 200 shares and a current price of 5.
